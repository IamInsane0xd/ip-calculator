# ip-calculator
subnet calculator, for my own school use (for some reason i called the project ip calculator)
there are dumb solutions in the project (see array.h), and its probably a lot overcomplicated
anyways, this was done for a learning opportunity, and when im finished ill probably do a cleaner version

---

# to use
open the solution in (preferably) vs 22, and build it.
